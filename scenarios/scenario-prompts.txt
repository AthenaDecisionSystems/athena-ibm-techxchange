Subject:  Covering my carpet cleaning

Dear IBU,

During the recent water leak at my house (cf claim 250303), my expensive Moroccan carpet was damaged by the water.  You told me that this damage is not covered by my policy. Iâ€™m very disappointed.  What do you propose?

Thank you!

Yours,

Sonya Smith
